# WiotMpdcli
 Remote Wio Terminal ( + Wio Battery Chassis 650 mAH) MPD client (Arduino IDE)
 
 A basic MPD client that shows the currently playing song on a headless RPI with MoodeAudio (or any other MPD based music player I guess).
 
 Because power saving (standby mode) does not work at this moment on the Wio Terminal, the TFT screen is disabled and you have to push the KEY_A button to active WiFi, connect to the MPD player, and display the current song, artist and file/radio station.
 and pushing KEY_B will display the battery status.
